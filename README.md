- Yolo Algorithm:-
  YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a deep learning algorithm used for real-time object detection. Unlike traditional methods that examine an image multiple times at different scales and locations, YOLO looks at the entire image just once. It divides the image into a grid and predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities for each grid cell. This makes YOLO fast and efficient for tasks like detecting objects in videos or live camera feeds, where speed is critical.

- Yolo V3
  YOLO v3 performs real-time object detection by dividing images into a grid, predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities for multiple objects, and using anchor boxes and feature pyramid networks for accuracy across different scales.
