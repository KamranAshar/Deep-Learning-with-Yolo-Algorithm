Yolo Algorithm:-

  YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a deep learning algorithm used for real-time object detection. Unlike traditional methods that examine an image multiple times at different scales and locations, YOLO looks at the entire image just once. It divides the image into a grid and predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities for each grid cell. This makes YOLO fast and efficient for tasks like detecting objects in videos or live camera feeds, where speed is critical.

Yolo V3:-

  YOLO v3 performs real-time object detection by dividing images into a grid, predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities for multiple objects, and using anchor boxes and feature pyramid networks for accuracy across different scales.

Essential components for configuring and using YOLO models effectively for object detection tasks:-

- COCO Names:

  These refer to the class names used in the COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset. COCO is a large-scale dataset used for object detection, segmentation, and captioning tasks. The class names typically include common objects and categories such as person, car, bicycle, etc.

- YOLO Weights:

  These are the pre-trained model weights for YOLO networks. These weights are learned during the training process on large datasets like COCO and are crucial for the network's ability to detect objects accurately. They contain the learned parameters (weights and biases) of the neural network layers.

- YOLO CFG Files:

  These are configuration files that define the architecture and parameters of YOLO networks. They specify details such as the number of layers, filter sizes, activation functions, and other hyperparameters. The configuration file (often with a .cfg extension) determines the network architecture used during training and inference.
